= How Estimated Delivery Date and Time Calculated? =

Estimated Delivery Date and Time are calculated by taking the estimated shipping date and adding the transit time (the time is taken to transit a package from the inventory location to the destination address). Normally, the transit time is calculated using business days. Holidays are also taken into account when calculating the transit time.

= How to start with Estimated Delivery Date plugin? =

The Estimated Delivery Date and Time plugin is easy to configure. In the general settings page, select the working days and set the day's cut-off time. In the Shipping Class settings page, set the estimated delivery date for all the shipping classes imported from WooCommerce Shipping Classes. Once you are done with configuring, the plugin will calculate and display estimated delivery dates in the mentioned places.

This Plugin also records Estimated Delivery Date of the order in the admin order details page and the same is added to the order email. Premium version will set the estimated delivery date based on Shipping Method and Shipping Zone.
